          My name is Mike Tritsch -think of it like Treech- and I am a multi-faceted musician and junior developer. I absolutely love learning new things, which is why I decided to start my journey into the world of code. I have a wide array -pun-intended- of experience across the music industry from journalism to performance. I've shared the stage with award-winning artists, worked in data-driven corners of the music business, and am now on a mission to combine my love of code with my love of music. I'm always open to collaborate, talk shop, and share music. Drop me a line, let's chat!

        <h2>My story...</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Colorado Springs, Colorado in a home that was full of music. I picked up the drums when I was 8 years old, and I've never looked back since. As I grew up, I learned how to play guitar, with a few other instruments along the way. My love for music went deeper than creating it, and transitioned into learning the inner-workings of the music industry. I attended college at the University of Colorado Denver where I earned my B.S. in Music Business.

          During my time in and after college, I set out to learn and contribute to as many facets of the music business as I could. I worked in music journalism for a top publication serving the Denver music scene, interned at a in-house music supervision firm, and shared the stage with award winning artists across the greater Denver area. In 2018, I had the opportunity to open up for Grammy Award winner Dua Lipa as the drummer for Los Angeles based artist Chloe Tang.

          In 2019, I moved from Denver to the live music capital of the country, Austin, Texas. In Austin, I worked as a Music Content Operations QA Analyst for Accenture onsite at Meta. This experience gave me an in-depth look at music publishing in the context of social media. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for software and web development. After a few self-guided courses online, I decided to attend The University of Texas' Full Stack Coding Bootcamp in hopes to combine my love of music with my love of code.
