## Description

Introducing the Trick or Tritsch Portfolio (Version 1). This dynamic portfolio was designed with the user in mind to convey professional, and a bit of personal information out to the world. Designed using React, this simple but clean portfolio website serves as a showcase of all my work...

...so far.

## What comes next? and other issues...

I was very excited to learn the ways of React, and I feel I've only scratched the surface. React simplified a lot of normally daunting concepts in regards to page design and consolidation.

Moving forward, I'd like to add more dynamic styling by exploring different React libraries and packages. 

It should be noted that the contact form within the website has no real functionality yet. Eventually, I'd like the form to route to my email. The purpose of the contact page was to demonstrate end-user error handling.

This is not the final version of my portfolio, but I feel I have a solid and presentable start.
